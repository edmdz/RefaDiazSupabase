# Postman collection

Import [refadiaz-supabase.postman_collection.json](/Users/eduardomendoza/Projects/RefaDiazSystem/RefaDiazSupabase/supabase/postman/refadiaz-supabase.postman_collection.json) into Postman.

The collection is configured for local Supabase by default:

- `baseUrl`: `http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1`
- `accessToken`: local anon JWT used by `supabase start`

Recommended execution order:

1. `01 Seed Reads`
2. `02 Brands Flow`
3. `03 Models Flow`
4. `04 Providers Flow`
5. `05 Persons Flow`
6. `06 Users Flow`
7. `07 Products Flow`
8. `08 Files Flow`

Notes:

- Create requests save generated IDs into collection variables, so the following `GET -> PUT -> DELETE` requests can be executed without manual edits.
- The collection covers the edge functions that currently exist in `functions/`.
- `login` / `logout` are mentioned in [functions/README.md](/Users/eduardomendoza/Projects/RefaDiazSystem/RefaDiazSupabase/supabase/functions/README.md) but there are no function folders for them in this workspace.
- Product components (`components`, `product_component`, `TAPA`) are documented as a feature in progress, but they are not exposed by the current `products` edge function implementation yet.
